# Introduction

## Mapeo is a free, easy-to-use, open source set of tools for collecting and mapping information.&#x20;

Mapeo was built by Digital Democracy with and for earth defenders to easily document environmental & human rights information and to collect data about their land. It was designed to work in entirely offline environments, is highly customizable, and built on a decentralized peer-to-peer database that allows communities to own their own data.
