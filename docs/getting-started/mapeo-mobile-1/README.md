# Mapeo Mobile

### Mapeo Mobile

Mapeo Mobile is a smartphone application \(currently for Android only\) that allows you to collect and map information in the field about places of interest. Using your phone's GPS, you can mark points on a map for your current location and add photos, notes and other details about what is happening. Information can be shared with collaborators who are using Mapeo, or with external contacts via email, SMS, or other messaging apps.

Mapeo Mobile is often used together with [Mapeo Desktop](../../mapeo-desktop-1/) to manage and edit data collected in the field.
