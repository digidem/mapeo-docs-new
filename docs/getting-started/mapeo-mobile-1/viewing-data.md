# Viewing & editing data

Once you have created one or more observations, you can view the data you have collected on a map or in list form.

### View observations on the map

On home screen of Mapeo Mobile, each observation you collect will be marked on the map with an orange dot. Note that observations you have just collected may appear directly on top of the blue dot marking your current location.

### **View observation details**

To view the details of an observation from the Map screen, simply tap on the orange dot marking the observation. If you have collected several observations in a small geographic area, you may need to zoom in on the map to see the different point.

### Edit details

Once you have the details of an observation open, you can edit the information collected by tapping on the pencil icon at the top right of the screen.

In Edit view you can change the category of the point, edit the description and details, or add additional photos. 

You can not change the geographic location saved with the observation, or the date and time of the original observation. On Mapeo Mobile, you cannot remove photos from observations once they have been added. 

### Save changes

You can save any changes you have made by tapping the orange checkmark button at the top right of the screen. Tap on the back arrow at the top right of the screen to return the the Map home screen.

To exit without saving your changes, tap on the back arrow at the top left of the screen and confirm you want to discard changes.

### View observations list

You can also view observations collected in a list by tapping on the cards icon at the top right of the Map home screen.

Here you will see a list of the observations you have collected with the most recent at the top. Identify observations by their category and the time they were saved. 

To view and edit the details of a specific observation, tap on the desired observation in the list.

### Delete observations

To delete an observation you have collected, open the observation detail view and scroll to the bottom and tap the delete icon. Deleting observations cannot be undone, so exercise caution when using delete.

{% hint style="warning" %}
As Mapeo uses a peer-to-peer database, all data is stored directly on the device and there is no back-up on a centralized server. By deleting observations, you will permanently remove them from your device and all devices you synchronize data with in the future.  
  
For more on synchronization, see [here](syncing-data.md).
