# Getting started

The Quick Start Guide is intended to help you install and test out the basic, out-of-the-box functionality of Mapeo in order to evaluate whether it will be a good fit. This section will not touch on all features or customization of the tools. 

The [Complete Reference Guide](../reference-guide/welcome-introduction.md) below includes critical information about how to design and implement a project using Mapeo as well as detailed guides for setup and customization of the tools. We recommend using it for starting a new initiative or as a training reference.
