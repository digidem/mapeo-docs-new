# Is Mapeo right for me?

There are many tools and pieces of software that you could use for making maps or documenting information. Mapeo was designed to meet the needs of specific users, who:

* are collecting data in primarily offline environments
* often have limited previous experience with technology
* do not want to share their data with external actors or centralized servers
* have specific data collection requirements
* want to view and gather information in their native languages
* need a tool that is free to use

Mapeo may not be the right tool for all projects. When evaluating whether Mapeo will be a good choice, we encourage you to try out the tool (see [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/getting-started.md) below) and please keep in mind the following:

* **Equipment requirements**\
  ****Mapeo Mobile is currently available for Android only. Mapeo Desktop works on Windows, Mac and Linux machines.\
  \
  Mapeo uses WiFi networks to synchronize data between devices. To synchronize data with Mapeo Mobile in offline areas, you will need a portable router (this does not require an internet connection) or a third device capable of creating a local network.\

* **Peer-to-peer architecture**\
  ****The Mapeo tools are based on a peer-to-peer database, which means there is no centralized server aggregating information collected by users. Two devices that are participating in the same Mapeo project can synchronize or exchange their data at a time.\
  \
  Sychronized devices have identical copies of the Mapeo database and can serve as backups if a device is lost or damaged. **Please note that data that has not been synchronized will not have a backup. **\
  \
  It is important to think through in advance how the participating users or devices in  your project will share information, as there are a variety of possible synchronizing patterns.\
