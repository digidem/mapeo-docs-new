# Syncing data

(with Mapeo Mobile ADD -or with another computer?)

During a synchronization process, the synchronizing devices share their databases in a bidirectional and non-hierarchical way, based on a <mark style="color:blue;">P2P</mark> system. That is, the information is shared directly between the different devices, and each device receives and shares data and in the end, the devices have the same database. Everyone ends up having the same information, which remains on the devices of Mapeo users. That means that community users have complete control over the data since it is not automatically sent to other distant cities or uploaded to a central online server.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
When a device synchronizes over WiFi with another device, both end up having the same information, this includes any edits that have been made to the data. For example, if a person deletes or edits an observation and then syncs with other devices, this observation will be deleted or edited on all synced devices.&#x20;

It is important to create project <mark style="color:blue;">synchronization protocols</mark> to ensure that all data becomes part of the project database.&#x20;

Synchronization can occur between two cell phones (Mapeo Mobile \~ Mapeo Mobile), between two laptops (Mapeo Desktop \~ Mapeo Desktop) or between a cell phone and a laptop (Mapeo Mobile \~ Mapeo Desktop).&#x20;

There are 3 possible synchronization ways:

* **Synchronization via WiFi:** if both devices are near and you have a WiFi network (with or without an internet connection).
* **Synchronization with a file:** if devices are not near.
* **Synchronization via web:** if both devices have an internet connection.

### Synchronization via WiFi

ADD DESCRIPTION

Requirements:

* **Both devices need to be connected to the same WiFi network.** The network does not require an internet connection, so you can create an offline WiFi network anywhere with a <mark style="color:blue;">portable router</mark>. Click <mark style="color:blue;">here</mark> for more information about it.
* **Use the same configuration and project key:** When starting a Mapeo project, all devices must be prepared with the same specific settings and the same project key. It is only possible to sync with devices that use the same configuration and key. That is, another person with Mapeo installed who does not meet these requirements, will not be able to synchronize and access the database.

If you don't fulfill these requirements, check out if synchronization <mark style="color:blue;">with a file</mark> or <mark style="color:blue;">via web</mark> would be better options for you.&#x20;

If you do, follow the next steps to synchronize your devices:

* Smartphone with computer??
* Computer with computer?
