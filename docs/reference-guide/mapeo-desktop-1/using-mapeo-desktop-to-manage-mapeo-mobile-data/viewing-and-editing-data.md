# Viewing & editing observations

(mobile data)

This section covers the several different ways to view and edit the observations collected with Mapeo Mobile in the Observation mode of Mapeo Desktop:

* Three ways to view all observations
* View single observation details
* Edit observation details
* Delete an observation
* Filter observations

### Three ways to view all observations

In the **toolbar**, you can choose between the following views to view the observations collected:&#x20;

* **Map view** - To view the observations as dots on a map. If the device is connected to the internet, by default, the map shows some geographical elements such as rivers and hills, as well as some political and urban elements such as borders, cities, roads, and others. If the device is not connected to the internet, no base map is shown. You can add a custom base map to view the observations in a tailor-made map. Read more about it <mark style="color:red;">here</mark>. Changing the map will not affect the information collected.&#x20;
* **Media view** - To open the photos of the observations in a gallery.&#x20;
* **Report view** - To view a PDF report of the observations.

Use the **Filter** panel to [filter ](viewing-and-editing-data.md#undefined)the visible observations in the **Map,** **Media,** and **Report** views. Read more about it [here](viewing-and-editing-data.md#filter-observations).

Click on one of the dots on the map in the **Map** view or on one of the photos in the **Media** view to [view ](viewing-and-editing-data.md#view-observation-details)or [edit ](viewing-and-editing-data.md#edit-observation-details)the details of the observation in the pop-up **View observation** window. From there you can also [delete an observation](viewing-and-editing-data.md#delete-an-observation).

### **View observation details**

Click on one of the dots on the map in the **Map** view or on one of the photos in the **Media** view to [view ](viewing-and-editing-data.md#view-observation-details)or [edit ](viewing-and-editing-data.md#edit-observation-details)the details of the observation in the pop-up **View observation** window. From there you can also [delete an observation](viewing-and-editing-data.md#delete-an-observation).

### Edit observation details

On the **View observation** window, click on a field to edit the information contained in it. You cannot edit the observation creation date, category type, or coordinates of an observation.&#x20;

### Delete an observation

Click on ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qHuT2QfG0zd1-dwSzlycqGUWCnwVfsKvzvqQQEOTAIZ3SnT58lHwvvvwrZBPsGOpXzpbuHTunPx9ssqhRFAYpSSc-gLrrZsHKNvEhGmo1Zn9XmmiETfBPePoKntyAs5R0tuvvvNc)**Menu**, select **Delete observation** and click on **Yes, delete** in the pop-up message.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Attention**: By deleting an observation, not only is the observation deleted in the **Observations** mode but also from **Territory** mode, and the next time you synchronize with another device (smartphone or computer) this observation will also be deleted from the databases of the synchronized devices.
{% endhint %}

### Filter observations

In the **Filters** panel, you can control which observations appear in the **Map**, **Media**, **** and **Report** views. This option is very useful for searching for specific information or focusing on relevant data as it allows narrowing down the search for observations by filtering by date, categories, etc. This is especially relevant when a lot of information has been collected.&#x20;

In the **Filters** panel, there are different tabs to choose the selection and filtering criteria. The two most relevant filters are the filter by **date** and the filter by **category**, although depending on the configuration you are using, you may be able to filter the data using other criteria, such as the area where the observation is located or the name of the person who has created the observation.

* **Filter by date:** to select and view only the observations created in a defined time frame. Click on ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-down.png)**Expand** <mark style="color:red;">beside</mark> ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Details.png>) <mark style="color:red;"></mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**Date of observation**</mark> and use the appearing calendars to define a temporary window indicating a start date and an end date. This way you can narrow down the visible observations.&#x20;
* **Filter by category:** to select and view only the observations classified within a specific category (for example, only the observations of fauna, or of mining, or of agriculture).

  * Use the checkboxes to select the categories that you want to make visible.&#x20;
  * Click <mark style="color:blue;">**ONLY**</mark> to only make visible a selected single category. &#x20;
  * Click <mark style="color:blue;">**ALL**</mark> to make visible all the categories.&#x20;
* **Combine filters:** to use more than one filter at a time to narrow your selection. This is a very useful option when we want to search for specific observations within a very large database. For example, you can filter by date and then apply a category filter to observations that are within the selected time range.

### Map view

In the **Map** view, observations collected using Mobile Mapping appear as dots on a map.

If the device is not connected to the internet, no base map is shown. You can add a custom base map to view the observations in a tailor-made map.
