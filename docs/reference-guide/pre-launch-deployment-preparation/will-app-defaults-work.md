# Will Mapeo work out-of-the-box for me?

When you install Mapeo, it will come with basic default settings that can be used right away, without any customization. The section below details what is automatically included with Mapeo so you can determine whether the app will meet your needs out-of-the-box.

Mapeo offers many options for customizing basemaps, categories, icons, questionnaires, and language, but the current customization process requires significant technical knowledge and will not be accessible to many users.

### **Default categories, icons and questions**

Mapeo comes with the a default configuration that includes the following data collection categories. Observations that do not fit these categories can always be collected using the **New point **category.

* Airstrip
* Animal
* Boundary
* Building
* Clay
* Community
* Fishing site
* Gathering site
* Hills
* House
* Hunting site
* Lake
* Palm
* Path
* Plant
* New point
* River
* Salt lick
* Special site
* Stream
* Swidden
* Threat
* Tree
* Waterfall

If Mapeo's default categories do not work for the needs of your project, you would need to create a custom configuration. For more on this process, see [creating-custom-configurations.md](creating-custom-configurations.md "mention").

### **Offline map**

If you have internet access while using Mapeo, a detailed map will automicatically be pulled in for your current location. The online Mapeo basemap is provided courtesy of Mapbox and includes a range of details, depending on what has been mapped in your region.

If you are entirely offline while using Mapeo, Mapeo Mobile by default will use a basic basemap that includes minimal details of land and waterways. Greater map detail will require generating and adding a custom offline map, a process which currently requires advanced technical knowledge.&#x20;
