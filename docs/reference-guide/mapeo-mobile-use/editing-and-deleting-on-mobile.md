### Delete observations

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Delete\_button.jpg)

To delete an observation you have collected, on the **View observation** screen, scroll to the bottom and tap ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Delete-trash.png>) **Delete**. You can only delete observations that you have created on Mapeo Mobile.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Deleting observations cannot be undone, so exercise caution when using delete.**

As Mapeo uses a peer-to-peer database, all data is stored directly on your device and there is no back-up on a centralized server. By deleting observations, you will permanently remove them from your device and all devices you synchronize data with in the future.\
