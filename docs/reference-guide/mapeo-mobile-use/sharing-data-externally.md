# Sharing data externally

In Mapeo Mobile, you can share the details of a single observation (location, images, description, and details) with a contact outside of Mapeo by using the ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Share.png>) **Share observation** feature. Share uses the communication apps you have installed on your phone (email, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, SMS, or other messaging apps) to send information.

Remember that most communication apps require an internet or cellphone connection to work.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Observation List screen - select observation>)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Share\_button.jpg)

On the **View observation** screen of the selected observation, tab  ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Share.png>) **Share observation**, which is located on the bottom of the screen.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Share observation options>)

Select the desired sharing app and enter the contact's information. \[Whatsapp, Gmail and Signal are the apps that currently work better to share Mapeo observations].

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always exercise caution when sharing data collected, as observations could include sensitive information about locations, activites or natural resources. Prior to sharing any data, reflect on basic security precautions.
