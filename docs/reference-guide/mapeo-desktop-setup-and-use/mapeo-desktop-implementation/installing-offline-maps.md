# Adding custom base maps to Mapeo Desktop

By default, Mapeo Desktop uses a[ base map](../../will-mapeo-work-out-of-the-box-for-me/default-base-map.md) that shows some geographical elements such as rivers and hills, as well as some political and urban elements such as borders, cities, roads, etc.&#x20;

If you have a [custom base map](../../pre-launch-deployment-preparation/custom-base-maps/), you can add it and use it in Mapeo Desktop without affecting the data collected. (For more on creating custom base maps, see [custom-base-maps](../../pre-launch-deployment-preparation/custom-base-maps/ "mention"))
