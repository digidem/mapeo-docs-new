# Syncing data via WiFi

Mapeo Mobile allows you to synchronize the data you have collected with other Mapeo users that are members of the same project. Syncing data does not require an internet connection and can be done in entirely offline areas.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that by synchronizing with another Mapeo user, **ALL DATA is shared in both directions**. You will receive all of the observations created by that user and they will receive all of your observations. Only synchronize with members of your project whom you trust with all of your data.
{% endhint %}

### Connect to WiFi

Syncing data between 2 devices requires that both devices be connected to the same WiFi network. **This WiFi network does not need to have an internet connection**. In offline environments, a local WiFi network can be created using a mobile wireless router, or by creating a hotspot using a third smartphone.

### Enter Sync mode

In order to synchronize, tap the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Sync.png>) **Synchronize** button on both devices.

The sync screen will show whether you are connected to a WiFi network.&#x20;

If connected, you will be able to see the name of the network you are connected to in the top left of the navy blue bar. You will also be able to see the unique identification number of your device on the right side of the navy bar.

Devices available for syncing will be listed on the **Synchronize **screen.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that in order for a device to appear on the list, it must be connected to the same network, have the Synchronize screen open, and be using the same project configuration. For troubleshooting on this step, see [[troubleshooting.md](../../troubleshooting.md "mention")](broken-reference)
{% endhint %}

### Synchronize data

Once available devices appear in the list, confirm the identity of the device you plan to synchronize with by consulting the unique identification number on the other user's phone.

Click on the **Synchronize **button beside the device name to begin the exchange of data. Keep the **Synchronize **screen open on both devices until the synchronization has been completed.

### View synced observations

You can view new observation data received in the synchronization by looking at the points on the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Map.png>) **Map **view or in the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>) **Observations list **screen.

Observations collected by other users will appear with a blue bar on the left side. On Mapeo Mobile, you cannot edit or delete observations collected by other users.

Remember that you can also view, edit and manage the data in Mapeo Desktop. Read more about it in [using-mapeo-desktop-to-manage-mapeo-mobile-data](../../mapeo-desktop-setup-and-use/mapeo-desktop-1/using-mapeo-desktop-to-manage-mapeo-mobile-data/ "mention").
