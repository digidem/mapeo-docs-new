# Viewing observations

Once you have created one or more observations, you can view the data you have collected on the map or in a list.

### View observations on the map

On the ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Map.png>) **Map **view of Mapeo Mobile, each observation you collect will be marked on the map with an orange dot. Note that observations you have just collected may appear directly on top of the blue dot marking your current location.
