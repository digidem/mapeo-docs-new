# Examples

Created a separate section for this as previously included in the "Why" section, but it was then making that section overly long. I am just leaving this here for now - I think perhaps there's a better way of doing it but will come back to at the end.

Maybe better than this would be 2 or 3 projects described in detail, answering all the questions that this whole planning section answers, maybe a couple for mapping and a couple for monitoring/data collection.

_Not sure best way of giving examples - dividing them up as below or putting them all together. I will leave them divided for now, and see how that works as I go through the other sections. It might turn out that picking 4-5 examples to use all the way through is the best way. Or perhaps using different short examples, and then at some point having more in depth example workflows._

_More examples to come if this is the right way to go._

**Mapping examples**

* Your community may want to record land related oral history from the elders, to protect it for future generations. Here you want to make a map as part of the process, helping with the storytelling, but it may not be the only product if you have stories and recordings as well.
* Your family or community may need a map in order to make a land claim from the State. The map is the goal of the mapping project, but a larger aim is for your land rights to be recognized. 
* The community may want to make a map of footpaths for visitors to use so they can locate themselves and see what the main important places are. Here the map is the end product.
* You may wish to create a basemap of community resources in order to illustrate the impacts of other activities or industries upon your land. The map is the product, but also part of a wider goal.
* The community may want to use mapping to help them think through changes in land and resource use together. Here mapping is part of the methodology, but the main product might be something else such as a management plan.

**Territory monitoring examples**

* You want to gather in-depth evidence about environmental, social and health impacts of oil developments in order to ensure company and State action is taken to address them. The evidence may be used in court as part of legal actions.
* You are concerned about ecological changes in your surroundings that may be linked to climate change and want to start gathering data to share with your community. You want to collect quite general information initially and then see if patterns emerge and possibly build more complexity into the data collection later.

**Data collection**

* You may want to use the apps in order to teach young people in the community about GIS techniques and technology. So the maps and data collecting are more part of the process than the end product, which is knowledge for the young people.
* You want to do a survey of households in your community, collecting similar information about each one as part of a school project. You want this information to feed into a community map and a report on some of your
