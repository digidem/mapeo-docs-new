# Checklist of questions

Use this list as a checklist to help you design your project. Try and provide answers to each of the questions. If you can't answer any yet, don't worry, just having considered it will help as you get started.

* What is your goal?
* What change do you want your project to support \(if any\)?
* What are your outputs?
* What data do you want to collect?
* Are there any rules and guidelines that will impact the data you collect and how to make it most effective? \(government rules or community rules\)
* Is your map or data going to be used in a legal process? If so how might this impact the way you collect data or the manner of data collected?
* What is your timeline? Are there any significant dates you are working towards?
* Do you have any funding / do you need any funding?
* Have you written a simple budget?
* Do you have any allies you can ask for support from \(technical, legal, press, financial\)?
