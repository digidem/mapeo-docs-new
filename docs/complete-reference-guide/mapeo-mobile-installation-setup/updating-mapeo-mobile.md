# Updating Mapeo Mobile

Like most existing apps, Mapeo Mobile is in continuous development. We frequently release new versions of the application to fix technical issues or add new functionality. When you **update** Mapeo Mobile, you do not lose data you have collected or synchronized using a previous version.

The process to update Mapeo Mobile is very similar to the installation process and there are 3 ways to do it:

* **Update from Play Store**\
  If you have an <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Internet_connection.png" alt="" data-size="line">**internet connection**, update to the latest version of Mapeo Mobile from the <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/12JKLq6v4NOosOrMWed5oh6WPYPge3hcwt2nwsmC1Bdq4AUQoQWTqN9Z2T2sgzRBxmjKjDb4nB40Xv3mH3U5TxH88r4BKnj_p25ERgOKOYGEYNby3VLvSWnWjYKn2w" alt="" data-size="line"> [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapeo\&hl=en\_CA\&gl=US). The steps are the same as for installing Mapeo: [#install-from-play-store](installing-mapeo-mobile.md#install-from-play-store "mention")\

* **Update from an APK file**\
  To update Mapeo Mobile on smartphones that have <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/no_internet_connection.png" alt="" data-size="line">**no internet** **connection**, follow the same steps as for installing the app using an installation file (`.apk`), this time using a more recent installation file: [#install-from-apk-file](installing-mapeo-mobile.md#install-from-apk-file "mention")\

* ****[**Update via P2P App Updates**](updating-mapeo-mobile.md#updating-mapeo-mobile-via-p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates) (\*Experimental)\
  Mapeo Mobile currently includes an experimental feature that allows you to update the version of the application offline via a peer-to-peer connection over Wi-Fi. For more on how to update this way, see[#updating-mapeo-mobile-via-p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates](updating-mapeo-mobile.md#updating-mapeo-mobile-via-p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
To update files used within Mapeo Mobile, such as configurations or background maps, follow the same steps detailed in the sections below using the new files:\

## Mapeo versions - information and naming conventions

Mapeo uses a numerical system to name versions ( for example `v.5.4.0`). The numbers are labeled as follows: `v.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

* The MAJOR number indicates a breaking change - a change in this number could be related to how the software work or a change in how you use it. The MAJOR number increases if features that were previously part of the app are now removed.
* The MINOR number increases when new features have been added to Mapeo.
* The PACTH number increases if there are small updates or fixes that donâ€™t introduce any new behavior or features.

If the MAJOR number increases, the MINOR and PATCH numbers are reset to 0. If the MINOR number increases, the PATH number is reset to 0.

{% hint style="info" %}
**To identify which version is more recent**, compare the version numbers (excluding the dots between digits). The bigger the number is, the newer the version is. For example, Mapeo v.5.4.0 is newer than Mapeo v.5.3.2, because 540 is a bigger number than 532.
{% endhint %}

## Updating Mapeo Mobile via P2P (peer-to-peer) App Updates

Peer-to-peer (P2P) App Updates is an experimental feature that allows you to share and receive newer versions of the Mapeo app by connecting to other Mapeo devices via Wi-Fi (no internet connection required).&#x20;

When updating the Mapeo app version in this way, **NONE** of your Mapeo data (observations, configurations, or maps) is shared between devices.

To search for and share Mapeo app updates between Mapeo Mobile devices, both smartphones must:

* have the P2P App Updates feature enabled
* have Mapeo open to the **Synchronize** screen
* be connected to the same Wi-Fi network

### Enable the P2P App Updates feature

To use this feature, you will need to enable it within the **Experiments** menu. To do so, tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app icons_observation-list_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line">**Observations list** button, then tap <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_Settings.png" alt="" data-size="line">**Settings**, and select **Experiments**. Select **P2P App Updates,** then check the box to **Use P2P App Updater**.

### Check for available updates

Once you have enabled the P2P App Updates <mark style="color:red;"></mark> feature, you will be able to use it on the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_Sync_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Synchronize** screen.\
\
To search for and share Mapeo app updates between Mapeo Mobile devices, both smartphones must have the P2P App Updates feature enabled, have Mapeo open to the **Synchronize** screen, and be connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_sync\_checking\_p2p\_updates.jpg)

If a newer version of the app is available from another Mapeo device on the network, the update will be automatically downloaded.&#x20;

(If your device has a newer version than other devices the network, you will see the message "Sharing app updates with other devices.")

### Install app update

To install the newer version of Mapeo, wait until the download completes, then tap **INSTALL** on the **Synchronize** screen.

### Allow installs from Mapeo

After tapping **INSTALL**, you may see a security pop-up window saying that your phone is not allowed to install apps from this source.

To enable Mapeo to install updates, tap **Settings** in the pop-up window and toggle the switch to **Allow from this source** in the following Android Settings screen.

&#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_P2P\_app\_update\_security\_window.jpg)![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_P2P\_app\_update\_Android\_settings\_allow\_install.jpg)

Tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_back_arrow.png" alt="" data-size="line"> **Back** button to return to Mapeo and confirm that you would like to install the update.

### Reopen Mapeo

When the installation is complete, Mapeo will close automatically. When you re-open Mapeo, you will see an update confirmation window. Tap **OK** to close the window and start using the new version of Mapeo.
