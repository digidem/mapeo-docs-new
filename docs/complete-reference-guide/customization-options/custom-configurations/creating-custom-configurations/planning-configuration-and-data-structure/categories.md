# Categories

### What are categories?

When collecting or creating data with Mapeo, each observation or element on the map is assigned a category. Users must select a single category when creating a new observation or map element, and categories can be broader or specific, depending on your context and project needs.

### Considerations when defining categories

* Categories are one of the key ways data can be filtered in Mapeo. Thinking through how you will view and use data once it has been offers useful perspective when defining categories.
* As a general rule, categories should not overlap - users should see only one option that fits when making a selection.
* Categories and what would fall within them should be clear to those who will be collecting data. Training and information sessions may be critical for ensuring project participants know how to gather data in consistent ways but clarity and simplicity in configuration authoring goes a long way.
* The space available to display category names is limited, especially on Mapeo Mobile, so names should be generally be brief.
