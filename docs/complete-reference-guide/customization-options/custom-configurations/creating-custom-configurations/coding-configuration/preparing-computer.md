# Preparing computer

## Prepare computer for building the configuration

Mapeo is built with JavaScript programming language. To get started, you'll need to install[ Node.js ](https://nodejs.org)development environment.. If you already have Node.js installed you can skip this section.

You need to be at least on Node.js version 8 (or higher) for the mapeo-settings-builder to work properly. Head over to [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page and select installer for your operating system.

Alternatively you can also use NVM (Node Version Manager) to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your computer.

### Install nvm

```
touch ~/.bash_profile
```

```
curl -o- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh> | bash
```

Then close terminal and open again

### Install homebrew (macOS)

[http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh)

### Install npm

[https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)

### Install and use node 12

```
nvm install 12
nvm alias default 12
```

### Install Mapeo Settings Builder

You'll see output on the terminal, but this is OK

```
npm install -g mapeo-settings-builder
```

## Is your computer ready?

If your computer is ready to create configurations, type

```

You should see output that looks something like

```
