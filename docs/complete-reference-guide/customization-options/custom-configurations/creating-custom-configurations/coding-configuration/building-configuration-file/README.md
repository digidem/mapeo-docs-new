Compiling your configuration into a `.mapeosettings` file is the final step for testing and using your configuration in Mapeo Mobile and Desktop.

Building a configuration can be done in two ways:

* [preparing-computer.md](preparing-computer.md "mention")(with Node.js and **mapeo-settings-builder**)
* [using-github-actions.md](using-github-actions.md "mention")
