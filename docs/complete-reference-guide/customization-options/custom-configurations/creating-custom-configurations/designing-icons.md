# Designing icons

## What is an icon?

Each of the presets you create needs to be assigned an icon, and these all need to be saved as `.svg` files.  You can assign the same icon to various presets, or they can each have their own individual one.

[See example icons](https://github.com/digidem/mapeo-default-settings/tree/master/icons) created for our default 'jungle' configuration.

## Creating Icons

Design icons as 100x100 pixel graphics that are clear when viewing at 100%.

### Using Adobe Illustrator

From Illustrator, File > Export

* Select SVG
* With the artboard box ticked
* Additional settings as below. These are how Mapbox says to export icons for svgs to use on their maps too.
