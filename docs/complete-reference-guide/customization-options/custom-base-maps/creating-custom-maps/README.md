# Creating custom background maps

We are currently working on a new user interface to simplify the process of generating and adding custom background maps to Mapeo. This page covers the generation of custom map files for both for the current (non-experimental) map server AND for the new experimental Background maps feature in Mapeo Mobile.

## **Current (non-experimental) workflow**

For creating custom background maps that work with the current (non-experimental) map server, you can view documentation of the existing process [**here**](https://digidem.notion.site/Preparing-and-Adding-Custom-Basemaps-to-Mapeo-b4f13019f0b842ce9315c6097f08ce36).

* For instructions on how to add these maps to Mapeo, see:\

## **New experimental Background Maps feature**

For generating map files in `.mbtiles` format to test out the new experimental Mapeo Mobile **Background Maps** feature, see [**here**](creating-custom-maps.md).&#x20;
