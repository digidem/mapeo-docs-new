# Data types within Mapeo

Perhaps this will be covered elsewhere in the quick start guide - but it seemed useful at this point so I've drafted something we can edit / move / refer to.

In terms of data types, **Mapeo Mobile** can collect:

* **GPS points:** so you can georeference particular points and places, and gather data associated with them. When saving a GPS point in Mapeo Mobile you need to categorize it with an icon. &#x20;
* **Photographs:** photographs get tagged with the GPS point of their particular location - **is this right?** -  as well as being attached to the place they are associated with.
* **Information**: if you set up a custom configuration you can add any number of questions into Mapeo so that you could carry out household surveys, collect quantitative information or evidence, or likewise write down detailed stories. Your questions can be text fields for open descriptions; select one; multiple choice; date or numbers **(not sure if this is all up to date and correct).**&#x20;

**Mapeo Desktop** can display and manage all of the above data types and additionally you can create georeferenced points, lines and areas with a basemap in the background. These data types can similarly have questions or fields associated with them that you fill in, and which can then be used for analysis.&#x20;
