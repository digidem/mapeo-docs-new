  Mapeo Desktop also offers an interface for adding or creating territory data directly within the Desktop application. **Territory** mode provides a basic toolkit for mapping features that are more accessible to new tech users than other available geographic information systems (GIS) tools. It also offers the option to import geographic information from an external source, and export map data in a `.GeoJSON` file format. Further manipulation or visualization of exported map data requires knowledge of other software.
