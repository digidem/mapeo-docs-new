# With a smartphone

Creating a _hotspot_, or portable Wi-Fi area from your smartphone, can be useful when synchronizing. Especially, if you don't have access to a Wi-Fi network or a portable router, you can use a third cell phone to create a hotspot and create a network to which other devices can connect and sync.&#x20;

You cannot create a hotspot and sync at the same time, so you will need an extra phone to create the hotspot.&#x20;

To create a hotspot, follow the steps below:&#x20;

### On the cell phone with which you want to create the hotspot&#x20;

1. Turn off Mobile Data on your phone. Details will vary for each phone, but Mobile Data settings can usually be found in the Quick Settings menu, which can be accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen. Click the switch to disable **Mobile Data**.![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)
2. On the main screen of your mobile, click on **Settings**&#x20;
3. Click **Portable Wi-Fi hotspo**t and turn it on using the toggle
4. Click **Set up portable Wi-Fi hotspot** and edit or review the password and hotspot name (SSID). You can view the password by clicking <img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt="" data-size="line">**View**.\
