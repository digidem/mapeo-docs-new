# GPS is not activated in Mapeo

To solve this problem, we suggest you explore the different solutions, in this order:&#x20;

1. First of all, make sure that you have **GPS** enabled on your cell phone. It will be different on each phone, but **GPS** or **Location** services can usually be found in the Quick Settings menu, which can be accessed by swiping down from the top of the screen. ​​\

2. Confirm that Mapeo Mobile has access to the GPS. The **GPS details** button at the top of the home screen will change from <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/GPS_details_activated (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">red to a green dot and the accuracy of the GPS signal <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/GPS_details_activated.png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

If you turn on the GPS on your device while using <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Mm-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line">**Mapeo**, you may need to restart Mapeo for the app to recognize that the GPS is turned on and change the status of the **GPS details** button. ​&#x20;
{% endhint %}

3. If the **GPS details** button at the top of the home screen remains red <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/GPS_details_activated (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">, make sure you have given Mapeo permission to use your phone's GPS.

4.  Confirm that the GPS sensors are enabled. For it:&#x20;

    1. Click on <img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/GPS_details_activated.png" alt="" data-size="line">**GPS Details**&#x20;
    2. On the **GPS Details** screen, make sure that in the **Sensor Status** section at the end of each line, it says **YES**.&#x20;
