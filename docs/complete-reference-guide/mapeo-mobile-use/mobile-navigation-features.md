# Activating GPS and viewing current location

## Enable GPS on your device

Mapeo Mobile uses the GPS of your device, so before you start using the application make sure that **GPS** or **Location** on your smartphone is enabled.

It will be different on each smartphone, but **GPS** or **Location** services can generally be found in the Quick Settings menu, which can be accessed by swiping down from the top of your screen.

## Confirm GPS access in Mapeo Mobile

On the home screen of Mapeo Mobile, you will be able to see if Mapeo is successfully accessing your device's GPS.

* If GPS is activated, the **GPS details** button at the top of the screen will show a green dot and the precision of the GPS signal:\

If you activate the GPS on your device while you are using Mapeo, you might have to restart ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Mobile.png) **Mapeo** for the app to recognize that the GPS is activated and change the status of the **GPS details** button.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you didn't allow Mapeo Mobile access to your phone's camera and GPS the first time you opened Mapeo, you won't be able to use GPS information or include pictures in your collected data.

## Viewing your current location

By default, Mapeo Mobile will mark your current position with a blue dot at the center of the map and adjust the map as you move.

If you pan to a different area on the map, you can always return to viewing your current location by tapping the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app-icons\_show-current-location.png) **Show my current position** button on the bottom right of the map.
