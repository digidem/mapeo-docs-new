# Collecting data

Users can collect data with Mapeo Mobile in the form of "observations." An observation is based on a geographic location \(a point on the map\) and can have associated photos, notes and details.

### Create a new observation

Create a new observation by tapping the round orange \(+\) button on the bottom of the screen.

Observations can be created from the Map homescreen or directly from the Camera screen. To switch to the Camera screen, tap the camera icon at the bottom right of the screen.

### Select a category

Select the category that best represents what you are documenting in the observation. Mapeo comes with a default set of categories and associated icons that can be used for collecting and classifying data.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible to create custom categories and icons to tailor Mapeo to specific data collection needs. This customization currently requires some technical knowledge. For more on customization, see [here.](../../pre-launch-deployment-preparation/creating-custom-configurations.md)
{% endhint %}

### Add a description

Tap in the white text area below your selected category to add a description of what you are documenting.

### Add photos & details

Tap on "Add Photo" to take one or more photos to attach to the observation.  Photos must be taken in the moment with your phone's camera; Mapeo Mobile does not currently allow you to attach existing images from a gallery or other source.

Depending on the category you have selected, you may see the option to "Add details" at the bottom of the screen. Observation details consist of specific questions that can be defined for each observation category. Mapeo Mobile comes with some basic detail fields for some categories.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to set up your own custom questions or details, you must customize Mapeo. See [here](../../pre-launch-deployment-preparation/creating-custom-configurations.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

### Save observation

Once you have added all desired information, tap the orange checkmark button on the top right of the screen to save your observation.

**Note on GPS precision**
