# Translating Mapeo & default configurations

Mapeo aims to be accessible to a wide range of communities in their native languages, and to faciltiate the process of translating the app and the [default configuration](../will-mapeo-work-out-of-the-box-for-me/default-configuration.md) into new languages as needed.

While [developing custom configurations](custom-configurations.md) currently requires significant technical knowledge, the process of translating Mapeo and the default configuration into a new local language may be an easier way to customize the tool for use in your project.
