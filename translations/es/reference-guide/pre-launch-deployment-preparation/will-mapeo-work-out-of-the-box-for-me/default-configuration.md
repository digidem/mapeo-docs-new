# Default configuration

### **About configurations**

Mapeo uses **configurations** to determine what categories, icons and questions users see when they are collecting data. For each data point collected with Mapeo, users select a **category** to classify the point, and may answer **questions** to provide more detail about what is being documented.

### Mapeo's default configuration

When you install Mapeo, it comes with a default configuration that includes general categories and questions for territory mapping and monitoring. The default configuration includes the following data collection categories:

Observations that do not fit these categories can always be collected using the **New point **category.&#x20;





Mapeo offers the option to create custom configurations to fit the needs of specific projects. For more information on customization, see [custom-configurations](../custom-configurations/ "mention").
