# Will Mapeo work out-of-the-box for me?

When you install Mapeo, it comes with default options that can be used right away, without any customization. This section details what is automatically included with Mapeo so you can determine whether the app will meet your needs out-of-the-box.



Mapeo offers many options for customizing basemaps, categories, icons, questionnaires, but the current customization process requires significant technical knowledge and will not be accessible to many users.

For more on customization options, see the following sections:

* [custom-configurations](../custom-configurations/ "mention")
* [custom-base-maps](../custom-base-maps/ "mention")
