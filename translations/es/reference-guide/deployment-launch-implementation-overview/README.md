# Deployment/Launch Implementation Overview



* who what where when how
* The tools are distinct enough to require separate but parallel implementation plans that are delivered by teams
* Coordination by the support team for deployment events requires the support team to be familiar with Implementation requirements \[Link to [2.4.M](https://www.notion.so/2-4-M-e355e11d6a5f45e386b0a85482827c8c)\] and vision for planned sessions \[Link to [2.5.M](https://www.notion.so/2-5-M-8905a95f5b4749fda1cc4b34cf708b46)\]
* Tech support - onsite, remote.
* Training events are the final piece of the implementation phase and often serve as the project launch day when a larger team or community is involved. In these cases, it is much easier when all other preparation and implementation tasks are complete before practical training activities. For participatory projects, iterations and smaller training trips are common, so the implementation tasks may overlap with other projects activities including preparation and use.
