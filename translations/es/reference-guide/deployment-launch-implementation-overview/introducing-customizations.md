# Introducing customizations



* not a requirement to use the app. See \[[1.1.M](https://www.notion.so/1-1-M-c802f6f47c12444b93971dff1729c879)\]
* is it required for participation in a project with customization?
  * Config - For a close project, yes. Why? Project key, Data structure
    * What happened if a participant is using default configs and later synchronizes data with a customized data structure?
      * no data loss. Generic category labels and notes appear in observation details, and some details may be viewed in "additional details" in Md
      * If participant later gets custom configs they can go back and edit observations with appropriate categories and details. Notes remain
  * Map - no, why? It's aesthetic and doesn't in any way affect the data. However from the user experience side, not having a familiar map with local geospacial details may be disorienting or too abstract.

Md and Mm have different steps to adding customizations.  See following sections as needed
