# Default configuration

### **About configurations**

Mapeo uses **configurations** to determine what categories, icons and questions users see when they are collecting data. For each data point collected with Mapeo, users select a **category** to classify the point, and may answer **questions** to provide more detail about what is being documented.

### Mapeo's default configuration

When you install Mapeo, it comes with a default configuration that includes general categories and questions for territory mapping and monitoring. The default configuration includes the following data collection categories:

Observations that do not fit these categories can always be collected using the **New point** category.&#x20;

For every data point collected, user can enter a description of what they are documenting. Default categories also include some additional optional questions or fields that users may fill out when collecting data. For example, the category **Fishing Site** includes the field: _Name (Common name of this place_).\ \ &#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_add\_details\_button\_fishing\_site.jpg)     ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_example\_details\_field\_name.jpg)

To review all fields included in the default configuration, install Mapeo and explore the categories.



### Beyond the default configuration

Mapeo offers the option to create custom configurations to fit the needs of specific projects. For more information on customization, see [custom-configurations.md](../pre-launch-deployment-preparation/custom-configurations.md "mention").
