# Sharing data externally

In Mapeo Mobile, you can share the details of a single observation \(location, images, description and details\) with a contact outside of Mapeo by using the Share feature. Share uses the communication apps you have installed on your phone \(email, SMS, Signal, Telegram or other messaging apps\) to send information.

Remember that most communication applications need an internet or cellphone connection to work.

Open the details for an observation and scroll to the bottom of the screen to see the Share button. Select the desired application and enter the contact's information.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always exercise caution when sharing data collected, as observations could include sensitive information about locations, activites or natural resources. Prior to sharing any data, reflect on basic security precautions.
