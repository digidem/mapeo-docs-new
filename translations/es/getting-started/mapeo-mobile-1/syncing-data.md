# Syncing data

Mapeo Mobile allows you to synchronize the data you have collected with other Mapeo users who are participating in your data collection project. Syncing data does not require an internet connection and can be done in entirely offline areas.

**Synchronization is only used between participants of a Mapeo project.** Please note that by synchronizing with another Mapeo user, ALL DATA is shared in both directions. You will receive all of the observations created by that user and they will receive all of your observations.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Only synchronize with users who are members of your project, whom you trust with all of your collected data.** There is no way to select a subset of observations to synchronize.
{% endhint %}

### About peer-to-peer

Unlike traditional apps where all the data is stored on a single server \(in the cloud or in an office\), Mapeo uses a peer-to-peer database which is integrated into the app on the device, and every device has a copy of all the data. For more about peer-to-peer and Mapeo's database, see [here](../../introduction/tools.md#mapeo-core-link-to-dev-pages).

### Connect to WiFi

Syncing data between 2 devices currently requires that both devices be connected to the same WiFi network. **This WiFi network does not need to have an internet connection**. In offline environments, a local WiFi network can be created using a mobile router, or by creating a HotSpot using a third smartphone.

Turn on WiFi on both devices and ensure that they are connected to the same network.

### Mapeo Sync screen

In order to synchronize, both devices must be on the Mapeo Sync screen. To open Sync, tap on the orange lightning bolt icon at the top left of the home screen.

The sync screen will show whether you are connected to a WiFi network.

If connected, you will be able to see the name of the network you are connected to in the top left of the navy blue bar. You will be able to see the unique identification number of your own device on the right side of the navy bar.

Devices available for syncing will be listed on the Sync screen. Remember than in order for a device to appear on the list, it must be connected to the same network, have the Mapeo Sync screen open, and be using the same project configuration file. For more on configurations, see [here](../../reference-guide/deployment-launch-implementation-overview/introducing-customizations.md).

### Synchronize data

Once available devices appear in the list, confirm the identity of the device you plan to synchronize with by consulting the unique identification number on the other user's phone \(on the right side of the navy bar\).

Click on the Sync button beside the device number in the list to begin the exchange of data. Keep the Sync screen open on both devices until the synchronization has completed.

When the sync process has completed, both devices will have identical data bases including all infromation previously present on each device.

### View observations

You can view the observation data received in the sychronization by consulting points on the Map home screen or by viewing the Observations list from the cards icon on the top right of the home screen.

Observations collected by other users will appear with a blue bar on the left side. On Mapeo Mobile, you cannot edit or delete observations collected by other users. For more on managing data with Mapeo Desktop, see [here](../../mapeo-desktop-1/).
