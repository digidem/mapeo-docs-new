# Updating Mapeo Mobile permissions

If you didn't allow Mapeo Mobile access to your phone's camera and GPS the first time you opened Mapeo, you won't be able to include pictures or GPS information in your collected data.&#x20;

To change that, go to **Settings** on your device, then click on **Apps**, **Manage Apps** and select ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Mobile.png) **Mapeo**. Click on **App permissions** and allow access to Camera and Location.
