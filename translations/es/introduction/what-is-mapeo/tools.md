# Mapeo tools

Mapeo is a set of digital tools, designed to support collaborative data collection and mapping in offline environments.

There are two highly-customizable Mapeo apps that can be used together or individually, depending on your goals:

* ****[**Mapeo Mobile**](tools.md#mapeo-mobile)
* ****[**Mapeo Desktop**](tools.md#mapeo-desktop)

Mapeo Mobile and Desktop are built on top of [Mapeo Core](peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md#mapeo-core), an embedded peer-to-peer database that allows users to own their own data, directly on their devices, without the need for an internet connection or to share information with a centralized server. For more on peer-to-peer and data sharing with Mapeo, see [peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md](peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md "mention").



## Mapeo Mobile

Mapeo Mobile is a smartphone application (currently for Android only) that allows you to collect and map information. Using your phone's GPS, you can mark points on a map for your current location and add photos, notes and other details about what is happening. Information can be shared with collaborators who are using Mapeo, or with external contacts via email or other messaging apps.

Mapeo Mobile can be translated into local languages, customized to use offline maps, and tailored to collect specific types of information.&#x20;

## Mapeo Desktop

Mapeo Desktop is a computer application that allows you to aggregate, view and manage data collected with Mapeo Mobile. Data from Mapeo Desktop can be shared with collaborators who are using Mapeo or exported to PDF reports, CSV files, GeoJSON files or published to the web using [Mapeo Webmaps](../../reference-guide/mapeo-desktop-1/using-mapeo-desktop-to-manage-mapeo-mobile-data/exporting-and-sharing-externally.md#export-as-web-map).

It also offers a simple interface for adding or creating territory information for making maps. Mapeo Desktop provides a basic set of mapping features that are more accessible to new tech users than other available geographic information tools, but exporting maps requires knowledge of other software.

Like Mapeo Mobile, Mapeo Desktop can be translated into local languages, customized to use offline maps, and tailored to collect specific types of information.&#x20;
