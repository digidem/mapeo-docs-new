# How Mapeo is being used

Mapeo is currently being used by a variety of communities around the globe to support territory mapping and monitoring efforts. Below are a few examples. For more detailed case studies, partner stories and information about other earth defender tools, check out [Earth Defenders Toolkit](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/).

**Environmental Monitoring in Peru**

> Indigenous Community monitors working within ECA-RCA in South East Peru are using Mapeo Mobile and Desktop as part of a co-management program of a Reserved area. Together with park rangers, they collect data on illegal gold mining and other impacts to the Reserve and use these for internal decision making and action as well as sharing with the authorities for any illegalities to be addressed.

**Territory Mapping in Kenya**

> The [Ogiek Indigenous People of Mount Elgon are using Mapeo Mobile and Desktop to map important sites](https://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/mapping-ogiek-ancestral-lands-in-kenya-using-mapeo-during-a-pandemic/) on their lands as part of a historical land claim.

**Ancestral Mapping in Ecuador**

> The Siekopai people of Northern Ecuador used Mapeo Desktop in their villages to explore satellite imagery of their ancestral lands with the elders, and document stories associated with lakes and old settlements. [Watch video](https://vimeo.com/175900565).

**Disaster-Risk Management for Climate-Vulnerable Populations in Thailand:**

> Village health volunteers in coastal Thailand are using Mapeo to collect data on vulnerable people, to ensure they can receive immediate and targeted help in case of natural disaster.
