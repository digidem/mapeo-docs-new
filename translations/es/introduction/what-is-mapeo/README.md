# About Mapeo

## Mapeo is a free, easy-to-use set of tools for collecting and mapping information. Mapeo is:

* **simple to use and learn**
* **capable of working offline, without internet or special hardware**
* **highly customizable**
* **based on user-owned, peer-to-peer databases**

Mapeo was co-designed and developed with Indigenous communities who face threats to their land such as illegal gold mining, oil contamination and poaching. It was built to support them to document these activities in order to take community action against, report key information to authorities, file lawsuits, launch media campaigns, or create maps for land claims. For more information on how Mapeo is being used, see a collection of [case studies on our Earth Defenders Toolkit website.](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/community/)

Mapeo is an open source software that benefits from continued feedback from our users across the world.

## Ke**y features of Mapeo**

* **Simple to use and learn**\ ****Mapeo Mobile is designed to be learned easily, even if you havenâ€™t used smartphones much before. It uses many icons so it can be easy to understand visually. Mapeo Desktop does require some computer skills, but has a simple interface with a limited number of features. There are plenty of other tools you can export your data to from Mapeo if more complex analysis or mapping work is required. This simplicity helps support wide community involvement and ownership of projects.\

* **Works in completely offline environments**\ Mapeo Mobile shares information by using WiFi networks between devices. These could be internet based, but can also be offline networks set up using simple portable routers that work with a computer or small battery as a power source. Mapeo Desktop can use these same networks for sharing data, and can also export data to files that can be shared on USB sticks.\

* **Uses a peer-to-peer database**\ This means that there is no centralized source of data, to which all team members or devices connect. Instead, all members of a project who synchronize with each other get copies of all the data on their mobile devices. It moves around the project network. The advantage of this is that data you have collected on Mapeo Mobile stays on your phone, and you can also see data collected by others on your team. It is a less hierarchical system of storing data than if it were stored externally on a server or online, and means that your community can maintain total ownership and control over the data if you wish. \

* **Customizable**\ Much of the Mapeo app is customizable in terms of language, maps and information you collect. When you download Mapeo, it comes with an offline map of the world, and a default configuration which you can use immediately to collect information about threats to land or rights. Mapeo has been translated into a number of languages already (including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai, Khmer and more) and can be translated into other languages. \ \ Mapeo can be customized by:
  * Translating the app into your local language
  * Creating your own list of things you want to collect information about, and designing your own associated questionnaires and icons for them
  * Designing an offline map, or maps, with the right type of information or detail to support your documentation. For example you might want a detailed satellite map, a map with the boundaries of mining concessions and land titles, or a map with elevation data to help you plan field trips.\

* Secure, unfalsifiable data
