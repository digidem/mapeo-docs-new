## Synchronize data

Mapeo Mobile allows you to synchronize data with other Mapeo users that are participants of the same project. During synchronization, ALL data from one device will be sent to the other device and vice versa. For more on synchronization, see: [peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md](../introduction/what-is-mapeo/peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md "mention").

To synchronize data between 2 Mapeo Mobile devices that are near each other:

1. Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi network. (You do not need to have an internet connection.)
2. Tap the ![](../.gitbook/assets/app\_icons\_Sync\_35px.png) **Synchronize** button on both devices.
3. On the **Synchronize** screen, identify the device you wish to synchronize with in the list and tap the **Sync** button beside its name.
4.  Keep the **Synchronize** screen open on both devices until the synchronization has completed.
