# Tech preparation before doing in-person training

To minimize the risk of unexpected tech issues spoiling your agenda and consuming valuable training time, make sure to prepare all the devices involved in a training event.

Here there is a checklist to review before the event:

### **Participant devices**

Ensure that:

* [ ] The operative system is updated
* [ ] The correct language is set up on phone and within Mapeo
* [ ] The device passwords are known
* [ ] The device is fully charged
* [ ] You have added the needed files to the device’s memory (Mm: SD or Internal memory, Md: USB)
  * [ ] Create a folder with needed files and guides. (i.e Mapeo for Community \[Name])
  * [ ] The most important Mapeo files needed for training are the latest installation files (they can have different formats, such as .apk, .exe, . dmg, etc.)
  * [ ] If a customized configuration and maps are being used in the Mapeo project, include that in a clearly labeled subfolder (.i.e Mapeo Configuration or Community x Configuration)

### **Trainer devices**

On top of the checklist for “participant devices”, make sure of the following:

* [ ] Presentation files in dynamic and static formats are loaded on your device.
