# Updating Mapeo Desktop

Like most existing apps, Mapeo Desktop is in continuous development. We frequently release new versions of the application to fix technical issues or add new functionality.

When you **update** Mapeo Desktop, you do not lose data you have collected or synchronized using a previous version.&#x20;

To update Mapeo Desktop, follow the same steps of the installation process using a newer installation file. Before starting, ensure that the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Md-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Mapeo Desktop** application is not open. Then, follow the steps below for:

{% content-ref url="installing-mapeo-desktop.md" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To update files used within Mapeo Desktop, such as configurations or base maps, follow the same steps detailed in the sections below using the new files:\ \ [importing-configurations.md](importing-configurations.md "mention")[adding-custom-base-maps-to-mapeo-desktop.md](adding-custom-base-maps-to-mapeo-desktop.md "mention")
