# Importing configurations to Mapeo Desktop

To start using a custom configuration, you'll need to import the new configuration file into Mapeo Desktop. For more on configurations, see [custom-configurations](../customization-options/custom-configurations/ "mention").

## Locate the configuration file

Download or copy the custom configuration file (eg. `example_project.mapeosettings`) onto your computer. Note which folder the file was saved in.

{% hint style="info" %}
For sending configuration files (`.mapeosettings`) between computers that have an![](../../.gitbook/assets/Computer\_internet\_icon.png) internet connection, we recommend using **email** or the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Telegram-logo.png) **Telegram Desktop** app, as other messaging applications have problems with this file format. You can also share a link to a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/drive.png)**Drive** directory where the configuration is located.



If you have ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Computer\_no\_internet\_icon.png) no internet connection, you can copy the file from a computer using a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)**USB drive** or send the file via ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bluetooth.jpg) **Bluetooth**. For more on these methods, see:  [sharing-files-between-devices.md](../troubleshooting/sharing-files-between-devices.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

## Import the configuration

1. Open ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Desktop.png) **Mapeo Desktop.**&#x20;
2. On the **Top menu** bar, click **File** and select **Import Configuration**.&#x20;
3. In the pop-up window, navigate to the folder on the computer where you saved the configuration file (`.mapeosettings`) you want to import. Click on the file, then click **Open**. You may see a white screen for a few seconds while the configuration changes.
