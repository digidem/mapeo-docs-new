# Synchronizing with a file



While other options allow the synchronization between smartphones and computers, synchronizing with a file is only possible between computers.

In this option, a sync file is created in Mapeo Desktop on one computer and then it is used by another computer with Mapeo to exchange data. During the synchronization, all data contained in the sync file is transferred to the computer that is syncing with it, and all data in the Mapeo database of the computer will also be transferred to the sync file. It uses the same two-way method as synchronization via Wi-Fi. To learn more about how synchronization works, see [peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md](../../../../overview/about-mapeo/peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md "mention").

* **If devices are near** each other, this is a good sync option when you can't create a local Wi-Fi network. You can instead use a ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)USB drive to copy and paste the sync file between different devices. It works with ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/Computer\_no\_internet\_icon.png)**no internet connection**.
* **If devices are not near** <mark style="color:red;"></mark> each other, this is also a good sync option. In this case, you will either need to transport a ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)USB drive to the location of the second device or have access to an ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/Computer\_internet\_icon.png)internet connection.&#x20;

Other requirements:&#x20;

* **Both devices must be using the same configuration**\
****It is only possible to sync with sync files created by devices that use the same [configuration](../../../will-mapeo-work-out-of-the-box-for-me/default-configuration.md#about-configurations). For more on how to import configurations, see[importing-configurations.md](../../../mapeo-desktop-installation-setup/importing-configurations.md "mention")[importing-configurations.md](../../../mapeo-mobile-installation-setup/importing-configurations.md "mention").

### Create a sync file

1. Open ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Desktop.png) Mapeo Desktop on ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/laptop\_icon.png) computer 1, the computer on which you want to create a sync file. The generated sync file will include **all** the Mapeo data from that computer.
2. Click on **Synchronize** on the **Mapeo modes** panel
