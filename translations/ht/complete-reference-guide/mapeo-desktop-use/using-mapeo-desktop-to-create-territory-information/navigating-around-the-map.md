# Navigating around the map

The background map that appears underneath the territory data is a vitally important resource for creating features. This map serves as your primary reference to where features might be located when you are creating or editing data.&#x20;

You move around the map by dragging it and by pressing and holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse around. You can also use the ↓, ↑, ←, → arrow keys on your keyboard.

You can zoom in or out by scrolling with the mouse wheel or trackpad, or by clicking the **+ Zoom in** and **- Zoom out** buttons in the **Map controls** menu on the right side of the map. You can also use the **`+`** and **`-`** keys on your keyboard.

If your computer provides your geolocation, you can also click on the<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FQtHbTb6AC4XLssfexdunzFqyxmksQan5SEjFbsgQETz7-YSRdA5CDiHRaOegrSG8eKfAUnQjrhishAEXT0QXNUA0I6aTEqzDAoeeD5PIUMv9Og9YiKaLbhRcYYs5UyamuKZ-xwG" alt="" data-size="line" />**Show my Location** button to pan to your location on the map.

You can also zoom to a set of geographic coordinates (in decimal degrees) by accessing the **Zoom to Coordinates** feature located in the **View** menu. Enter a pair of longitude and latitude coordinates separated by a comma and with longitude going first, and then click Submit. The background map should travel to the coordinates.

The **+ Zoom in to edit** button appears at the top of your screen when you are not sufficiently zoomed in. You can press it to zoom in to a minimum high zoom level where editing is possible. Once you have created territory data, you can also use the **Zoom to Data** feature located in the View menu to zoom to the maximum extent of your territory data on the map.

Lastly, it is possible to activate an **overview map** at the top of the map, by pressing the `/` key.
