# I can't start Mapeo

1. **Make sure you have Mapeo installed on your phone or computer.** If you are not clear about the steps to install Mapeo, check: â€‹

* [installing-mapeo-desktop.md](../mapeo-desktop-installation-setup/installing-mapeo-desktop.md "mention")

Once installed, you have to click on the Mapeo icon on your cell phone (<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Mm-icon.png" alt="" data-size="line" />Mapeo Mobile) or on your computer (<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/bdNxQRS9mSJlaKfeYAUuqnhwjnkpXLYxjXEraIF2Y6JG7eyWI_grgr8HJ5PKGER8wB3xIgmLse9XuLQKxRlcLrYc1ZV8fzB6GwNRV22uGoWWcQ2dtQs2RKh1XN_v8PocFOMU24L6" alt="" data-size="line" />Mapeo Desktop). If despite this, it does not work, go to the next point.&#x20;

2\. **Reboot your device and try again.**&#x20;

3\. **Make sure your device has enough free space available.**

If none of this works, there are unfortunately few solutions:&#x20;

a) You can uninstall Mapeo Mobile from your cell phone, but **YOU WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA** you have collected so far. You will only be able to recover them if you have previously synchronized with another device.&#x20;

b) You can contact Digital Democracy using our multilingual mapping-users chat at [Discord](https://digital-democracy.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e5898ac1e68db70ce0dfefa88\&id=af17ade556\&e=c6a0dac4c6).
