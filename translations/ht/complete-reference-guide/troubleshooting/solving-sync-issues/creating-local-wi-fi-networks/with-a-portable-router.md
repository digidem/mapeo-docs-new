# With a portable router

We recommend using portable wireless routers of the TP-LINK type.&#x20;

To connect to the router, follow the steps below:&#x20;

1. Connect the router to a power source, such as a computer, using the USB cable.&#x20;
2. Make sure the router is in 3G/4G mode (there is a button on the side of the router).&#x20;
3. On the phones and/or computers you want to synchronize, search for the Wi-Fi network created by the router. The router has a label attached to it, with the name of your Wi-Fi network and the password. \

   \
   SSID indicates the name of the WiFi Network, in this example, it is `TP-Link_2088` \
   KEY / PIN indicates the password, in this example, it is `57880457`&#x20;
4. Enter the password on the cell phones and/or computers you want to sync. Now they should be ready to be able to sync Mapeo data.
