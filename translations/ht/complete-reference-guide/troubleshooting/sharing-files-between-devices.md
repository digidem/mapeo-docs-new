# Sharing files between devices

See the sections below for different file sharing options:

* [Sharing files between devices with an ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Internet\_connection.png)**internet connection**](sharing-files-between-devices.md#sharing-files-between-devices-with-an-internet-connection)
* [Sharing files between devices with ![](../../.gitbook/assets/no\_internet\_connection.png)**no internet connection**](sharing-files-between-devices.md#sharing-files-between-devices-with-no-internet-connection)

## **Sharing files between devices with an internet connection**

If you have access to an ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Internet\_connection.png)**internet connection**, you can share files in multiple ways. The optimal way depends on the size and type of the file. Below are our recommendations:

* [From a smartphone](sharing-files-between-devices.md#from-a-smartphone)
* [From a computer](sharing-files-between-devices.md#from-a-computer)

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Smartphone\_icon.png) FROM A SMARTPHONE

Some Mapeo files can be tricky to share from a Mapeo Mobile smartphone, because of their special formats. We recommend using ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Telegram-logo.png)**Telegram** app, ![](../../.gitbook/assets/email.png)**email,** or ![](../../.gitbook/assets/drive.png)**Google Drive** to share the following files:

* Configuration files (`.mapeosettings`)
* Installation files for Mapeo Mobile (`.apk`)&#x20;
* Base maps (folder `.zip`)&#x20;

To share and add base maps to Mapeo Mobile, we recommend using a computer and a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_cable.png)USB cable, because it requires navigation inside the file system of the smartphone and pasting the base map elements in a specific location. For instructions on that process, see [adding-custom-base-maps-to-mapeo-mobile.md](../mapeo-mobile-installation-setup/adding-custom-base-maps-to-mapeo-mobile.md "mention")\
\
You can also share larger files (up to 2GB) for free via ![](../../.gitbook/assets/DROPBOX.jpg)Dropbox, ![](../../.gitbook/assets/WE\_TRANSFER.png)WeTransfer, or other online platforms.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sending installation (`.apk`) and configuration (`.mapeosettings`) files with other apps encounter problems with the size and type of the files.
{% endhint %}

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/laptop\_icon.png) FROM A COMPUTER

These are the most common Mapeo files that you will want to share from a Mapeo Desktop computer:

* Configuration files (`.mapeosettings`)&#x20;
* Installation files for Mapeo Desktop (`.exe`, `.dmg` , `.zip` , `.AppImage`)&#x20;
* Base map folders&#x20;
* Sync files (`.mapeodata`)&#x20;

You can use multiple platforms to share files.&#x20;

* We recommend using email apps such as ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Gmail-logo.png)Gmail or ![](../../.gitbook/assets/HOTMAIL\_icon.jpg)Hotmail for sharing lightweight files (smaller than 10MB).&#x20;
* We recommend using ![](../../.gitbook/assets/drive.png)Drive, ![](../../.gitbook/assets/DROPBOX.jpg)Dropbox, ![](../../.gitbook/assets/WE\_TRANSFER.png)WeTransfer to share heavier files as they allow you to send up to 2GB for free. You can use the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Telegram-logo.png)Telegram Desktop app to send up to 1.5GB.

## **Sharing files between devices with no internet connection**

If you do ![](../../.gitbook/assets/no\_internet\_connection.png)not have access to an internet connection, there are multiple ways to share files between devices.

* [Copy and paste files using a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)USB drive or ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_cable.png)cable (this is easier to do if you have a computer)](sharing-files-between-devices.md#using-a-usb-cable-drive)
* [Send via ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bluetooth.jpg)Bluetooth, ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/shareit (1) (1) (1).jpg>)SHAREit or other apps](sharing-files-between-devices.md#using-bluetooth)

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_cable.png)![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)USING A USB CABLE/DRIVE

For transferring files between computers without an internet connection, we recommend using a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)USB drive or a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_cable.png)cable. Although most computers can also share files [via Bluetooth ](sharing-files-between-devices.md#using-bluetooth)with other devices that are nearby, commonly shared files for Mapeo Desktop can be very heavy (e.g. Sync files (`.mapeodata`)) and Bluetooth could take much longer than using a USB cable or drive.

**Example**: In this example, we will share a Mapeo installation file from one computer to another one completely ![](../../.gitbook/assets/no\_internet\_connection.png)offline, using a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_stick\_memory.png)USB drive.

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bluetooth.jpg) USING BLUETOOTH

Android devices that are near each other can use ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bluetooth.jpg)Bluetooth to transfer files without an internet connection. The Bluetooth transfer will be quicker for lighter weight files, such as:

* Configuration files (`.mapeosettings`)
* Installation files for Mapeo Mobile (`.apk`)

To transfer files using Android's Bluetooth:

1. Activate ![](../../.gitbook/assets/bluetooth.jpg)**Bluetooth** on both devices. Bluetooth settings can generally be found in the Quick Settings menu, accessed by swiping down from the top of your screen.
2. On the Bluetooth settings screen, tap **Pair new device** and wait for the list of AVAILABLE DEVICES to populate.\
   The screen of both devices should be open and unlocked to appear available for syncing.
3. Once you see the device you would like to share files with and confirm its identity, tap on the device name to pair.
4. Confirm the code and the pair request on both devices.
5. Locate and select the file you wish to send and tap ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app\_icons\_share\_35px.png) **Share**. Select **Bluetooth** in the share options and tap the name of the other device in the list.

You can also use Android apps for Bluetooth sharing, including ![](../../.gitbook/assets/shareit (1) (1) (1).jpg)SHAREit or others.

{% hint style="warning" %}
For transferring larger files (bigger than 10MB) such as base map folders, we recommend connecting to a computer and transferring via ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_cable.png)cable if possible.\
