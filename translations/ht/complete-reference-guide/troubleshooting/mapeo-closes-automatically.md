# Mapeo closes automatically

Unfortunately, when this occurs there are few solutions.&#x20;

a) You can uninstall Mapeo Mobile from your cell phone, but **YOU WILL LOSE ALL THE DATA** you have collected so far. You will only be able to recover them if you have previously synchronized with another device.&#x20;

b) You can contact Digital Democracy using our multilingual **mapeo-users** chat at [Discord](https://digital-democracy.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e5898ac1e68db70ce0dfefa88\&id=af17ade556\&e=c6a0dac4c6).
