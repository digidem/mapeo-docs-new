# Custom base maps

### About custom base maps

Custom background maps allow Mapeo users to incorporate a wide range of geographical datasets and relevant elements into the maps used for displaying current position and data collected. Once added to Mapeo, custom background maps are available completely offline within the application.

### Creating custom base maps

{% hint style="warning" %}
Creating custom base maps currently requires significant technical knowledge and will not be accessible to all users.

The current process, detailed in [creating-custom-maps.md](creating-custom-maps.md "mention"), requires comfort installing and using `node` packages via the command line.
