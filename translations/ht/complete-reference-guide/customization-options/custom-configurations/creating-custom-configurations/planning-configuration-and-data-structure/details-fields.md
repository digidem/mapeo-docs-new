# Details fields

For each category in your configuration, you can include one or more structured fields (like a mini form or questionnaire) that users can optionally fill out when creating a new observation or map element with that category.\
\ Details fields can be text fields (type in your own answer) or multiple choice (select one or select many from a set of pre-defined answers).\
\ When planning your data structure, you should think through which (if any) details fields you would like to include for each category.&#x20;





Considerations

* typing in the field vs. report needs
* stress, sun, risk,
* clarity, language, icons
