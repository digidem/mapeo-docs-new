# Sharing data externally

In Mapeo Mobile, you can share the details of a single observation (location, images, description, and details) with a contact outside of Mapeo by using the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_share_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Share observation** feature. **Share** uses the communication apps you have installed on your phone (email, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or others) to send information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that communication apps will require an internet connection or cell signal to work.
{% endhint %}

Open the **View observation** screen for the selected observation and tap <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_share_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Share**, which is located at the bottom left of the screen.

Select the desired sharing app and enter the contact's information. <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/WhatsApp-logo.png" alt="" data-size="line" />WhatsApp, <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Signal-logo.png" alt="" data-size="line" />Signal and <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Gmail-logo.png" alt="" data-size="line" />Gmail are the apps that currently work best for sharing Mapeo observations.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always exercise caution when sharing data collected, as observations could include sensitive information about locations, activities, or natural resources. Prior to sharing any data, think through basic security precautions.
