**Deleting observations cannot be undone, so exercise caution when using delete.**

As Mapeo uses a peer-to-peer database, all data is stored directly on your device and there is no backup on a centralized server. By deleting observations, you will permanently remove them from your device and all devices you synchronize data with in the future.\ \ For more on synchronization, see [peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md](../../overview/about-mapeo/peer-to-peer-and-mapeo-sync.md "mention")
