# Creating observations

You collect data with Mapeo Mobile in the form of _observations_. An observation is based on a geographic location (a point on the map) and can have associated photos, notes, and details.

## Create a new observation

To create a new observation, tap the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create\_observation.png)**Create observation** button.

&#x20;<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Homescreen-Create_observation_button.jpg" alt="" data-size="original" />

{% hint style="info" %}
Observations can be created from the home <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app-icons_Map_view.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Map** screen or from the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app icons_Photo-Camera.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Camera** screen. Tap <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app icons_Photo-Camera.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Camera**  at the bottom of the home screen to change the view.
{% endhint %}

## Select a category

Select the category that best represents what you are documenting in the observation. Mapeo comes with a default set of categories and associated icons that can be used for collecting and classifying data.

### ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Categories\_screen.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
It is possible to create custom categories and icons to tailor Mapeo to specific data collection needs. This customization currently requires significant technical knowledge. For more on customization, see [custom-configurations](../customization-options/custom-configurations/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

## Add a description

Tap on the placeholder **What is happening here?** to add a description of what you are documenting.

## Add photos

Tap <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app icons_Photo-Camera.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Add Photo** to take one or more photos to attach to the observation.

&#x20;![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_new\_observation\_add\_photo.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Photos must be taken in the moment using your phone's camera. Mapeo Mobile does not currently allow you to attach existing images from a gallery or other source.
{% endhint %}

To remove a photo from a draft observation, tap on the thumbnail of the image. On the **View image** screen, tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/icon-delete_image_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" />**Delete Image** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the **Delete Image** button is not visible on the **View image** screen, tap anywhere on the screen to show.\
\ \*Deleting images from draft observations is only available in Mapeo Mobile version **5.4.0** or higher.
{% endhint %}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Delete\_photo\_button.jpg)&#x20;

To confirm deletion, tap **Delete Image** in the confirmation window. Please note that once deleted, images cannot be recovered.

If you don't wish to proceed with the deletion, tap **Cancel** then tap the <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/icon-close-35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Close** button to return to the **New observation** screen.&#x20;

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Delete\_photo\_confirmation.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
Images cannot be removed once an observation has been saved.
{% endhint %}

## Add details

Depending on the category you have selected, you may see the option to <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app icons_Details.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Add details** at the bottom of the screen. Observation details consist of specific questions for each observation category. Mapeo Mobile comes with basic questions for some categories. Adding details is not required when creating observations.

Tap <mark style="color:blue;">**NEXT**</mark> to move to the next question and tap <mark style="color:blue;">**DONE**</mark> once you have answered the last one.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_add\_details\_button\_475pxMed30.jpg)  ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_details\_camp\_category\_select\_DONE.jpg)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_View\_observation\_screen\_add\_details.jpg) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_details\_camp\_category\_select\_DONE.jpg)

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to set up your own custom questions or details fields, you must customize Mapeo. For more information, see [custom-configurations](../customization-options/custom-configurations/ "mention")
{% endhint %}

## Save observation

Once you have added all desired information, tap <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_save_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Save**.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Save\_observation.jpg)

### \* Note on GPS precision

If the GPS signal at the moment of saving the observation has an accuracy worse than ± 10 m, Mapeo will automatically offer you three options:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Weak\_GPS\_signal\_message.jpg)

1. Tap **CONTINUE WAITING** to wait until the GPS signal improves.
2. Tap **SAVE** to use the current GPS data, even if the accuracy is worse than ± 10 m.
3. Tap **MANUAL COORDS** to manually enter the coordinates that you want to use.\
\ ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Weak\_GPS\_message\_manual\_coords\_option.jpg)\
\ You can choose which GPS data format you want to use to enter the coordinates. This is a useful option if you have a GPS device or another smartphone with a better GPS signal accuracy.\
\ ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Enter\_coordinates\_screen\_format\_menu.jpg) ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_Enter\_coordinates\_screen-format\_options.jpg)\
\ Tap <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_save_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Save** once you have manually entered the coordinates to return to the **Edit observation** screen.
