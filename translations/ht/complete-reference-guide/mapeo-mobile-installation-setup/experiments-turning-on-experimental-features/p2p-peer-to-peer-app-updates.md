# P2P (peer-to-peer) App Updates

**Peer-to-peer (P2P) App Updates** is an experimental feature that allows you to share and receive newer versions of the Mapeo app by connecting to other Mapeo devices via Wi-Fi (no internet connection required).&#x20;

When updating the Mapeo app version in this way, **NONE** of your Mapeo data (observations, configurations, or maps) is shared between devices.

To test out this feature, you will need to enable it within the **Experiments** menu. To do so, tap the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_observation-list\_35px.png)**Observations list** button, then tap ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app\_icons\_Settings.png)**Settings**, and select **Experiments**. Select the **P2P upgrades** checkbox to activate.
