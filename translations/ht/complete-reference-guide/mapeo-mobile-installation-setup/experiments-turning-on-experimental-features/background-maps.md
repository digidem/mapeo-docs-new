# Background Maps

**Mapeo Mobile** 5.5.0 introduces a new **Map Manager** user interface for importing and managing multiple background maps. The new experimental **Background Maps** feature allows you to add your own custom maps and switch between multiple maps.&#x20;

WARNING: When this feature is enabled, you will not have access to the map you had previously been using in Mapeo. Turn off Map Manager to switch back to your previous map.&#x20;
