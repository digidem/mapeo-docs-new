# Experiments: Turning on experimental features

## Experiments

The **Experiments** screen within the **Settings** menu contains new, experimental features that are in ongoing development. They can be activated and used in their current state and will be improved and moved out of the Experiments section in future app updates.

The features currently available in **Experiments** are:

* ****[directional-arrow.md](directional-arrow.md "mention")****
* ****[p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates.md](p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates.md "mention")****
* [background-maps.md](background-maps.md "mention")
