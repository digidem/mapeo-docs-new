## Experiments

The **Experiments** screen contains new, experimental features that are in ongoing development. They can be activated and used in their current state and will be improved and moved out of the Experiments section in future app updates.

There are currently 2 features available in **Experiments**:

* ****[**Directional Arrow**](app-settings.md#undefined)****
* [**P2P App Updates**](updating-mapeo-mobile.md#updating-mapeo-mobile-via-p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates)****

### Directional Arrow

The new Directional Arrow feature uses your smartphone’s digital compass to provide information about which direction your phone is facing. Close proximity to large metal objects or strong magnetic field can affect the precision of the compass.

If your smartphone doesn’t have a compass, the Directional Arrow may still be able to determine direction based on movement. Direction based on movement may be less accurate.

**NOTE:** Directional Arrow is not reliable enough to be used exclusively for navigation, and it may drain your device battery faster.

#### Turn on Directional Arrow

To activate the Directional Arrow feature:

1. Click on ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_observation-list\_35px.png) **Observations List,** then click on ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app\_icons\_Settings.png) **Settings** and select **Experiments.**
2. Select **Directional Arrow**, then click the checkbox to **Use Directional Arrow**.
3. Click on ![](../../.gitbook/assets/app\_icons\_back\_arrow.png) **Back** as many times as necessary to return to the home **Map** screen to view the arrow.
