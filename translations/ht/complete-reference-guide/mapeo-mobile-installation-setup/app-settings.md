* [#experiments](app-settings.md#experiments "mention") (activate experimental features)

## Language

Mapeo Mobile is currently available in more than 15 languages, but it can be translated into any additional language using the Crowdin platform. For more on translation, see: [translating.md](../customization-options/translating.md "mention")

## Experiments

The **Experiments** screen contains new, experimental features that are in ongoing development. They can be activated and used in their current state and will be improved and moved out of the Experiments section in future app updates.

There are currently 2 features available in **Experiments**:

* ****[**Directional Arrow**](app-settings.md#directional-arrow)****
* [**P2P App Updates**](updating-mapeo-mobile.md#updating-mapeo-mobile-via-p2p-peer-to-peer-app-updates)****

### Directional Arrow

The new Directional Arrow feature uses your smartphone’s digital compass to provide information about which direction your phone is facing. Close proximity to large metal objects or strong magnetic field can affect the precision of the compass.

If your smartphone doesn’t have a compass, the Directional Arrow may still be able to determine direction based on movement. Direction based on movement may be less accurate.

**NOTE:** Directional Arrow is not reliable enough to be used exclusively for navigation, and it may drain your device battery faster.
{% endhint %}

1. Click on <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app icons_observation-list_35px.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Observations List,** then click on <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/app_icons_Settings.png" alt="" data-size="line" /> **Settings** and select **Experiments.**
