# Default configuration

### **About configurations**

Mapeo uses _configurations_ to determine which categories, icons and questions users see when they are collecting data. For each data point collected with Mapeo, users select a category to classify the point, and may answer questions or respond to prompts to provide more detail about what is being documented.

### Mapeo's default configuration

When you install Mapeo, it comes with a default configuration that includes general categories and questions for territory mapping and monitoring.

#### Categories

The default configuration includes the following data collection categories:

Observations that do not fit these categories can always be collected using the **New point** category.

**Questions**

For every data point collected, users can enter a description of what they are documenting. Default categories also include some additional optional questions or fields that users may fill out when collecting data. For example, the category **Fishing Site** includes the field: _**Name** (Common name of this place_).\

To review all fields included in the default configuration, install Mapeo and explore the **Add Details** section for each category.

### Beyond the default configuration

Mapeo offers the option to create custom configurations to fit the needs of specific projects. For more information on customization, see [custom-configurations](../customization-options/custom-configurations/ "mention").
