# Sharing data externally

In Mapeo Mobile, you can share the details of a single observation (location, images, description, and details) with a contact outside of Mapeo by using the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Share.png) **Share observation** feature. Share uses the communication apps you have installed on your phone (email, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, SMS, or other messaging apps) to send information.

Remember that most communication apps require an internet or cellphone connection to work.

On the **View observation** screen of the selected observation, tab  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Share.png) **Share observation**, which is located on the bottom of the screen. Select the desired sharing app and enter the contact's information.
