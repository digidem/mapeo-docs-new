# Viewing data on mobile

Once you have created one or more observations, you can view the data you have collected on the map or in a list.

### View observations on the map

On home screen of Mapeo Mobile, each observation you collect will be marked on the map with an orange dot. Note that observations you have just collected may appear directly on top of the blue dot marking your current location.

### View observations in a list

Tap on the cards icon at the top right of the Map screen to view your observations in list form.

### **View observation details**

To view the details of an observation from the Map screen, tap on the orange dot marking the observation. If you have collected several observations in a small geographic area, you may need to zoom in on the map to see the different point.
