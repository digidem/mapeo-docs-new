# Viewing observations

To view and manage synchronized observations in Mapeo Desktop, click on **Observations** in the **Mapeo modes** panel on the left side of the screen.&#x20;

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Md\_Observations\_mode.jpg)

**Observations** mode offers 3 different options for viewing observations in your database. In the **Toolbar**, you can choose between the following views:

* ****[**Map view**](viewing-observations.md#map-view)****
* ****[**Media view**](viewing-observations.md#media-view)****
* ****[**Report view**](viewing-observations.md#report-view)****

### Map view

In the default **Map** view, observations are displayed as dots on a map. Use your computer's mouse or the **Zoom** controls at the top right of the map to ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-plus-01.png)zoom in and ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-minus-01.png)zoom out and navigate to different locations on the map.

Hover your mouse over an individual dot on the map to preview the associated observation. Click on a dot to view the full details of that observation in the **View observation** window. Click on the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-down.png)**Expand** button to view all fields in each section.

### **Report view**

To view observations in the form of a report, click on **Report** in the **Toolbar. Report** view displays one observation per page and includes the category, coordinates, date, a map of the location, and any images associated with the observation.

Use the **Next** ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_next arrow.png) and ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_back arrow.png) **Previous** buttons at the bottom of the screen to step through each page of the report.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Md\_report\_view\_button.jpg)

You can filter observations included in the report using the [**Filter** panel](viewing-observations.md#filter-observations), and hide additional data fields using the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/hide.png) **Hide fields** controls in the grey panel above the report.

## **Filter observations**

To look at a subset of your observations in **Map**, **Media** or **Report** view, use the **Filter** panel. Observations can be filtered by date, category, and some details fields used to collect the data.

To apply a filter, click the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-down.png)**Expand** button beside the desired filter section and adjust the filter criteria. Multiple filters can be used at the same time.

### Filter by date

To filter observations by a specific date range, click ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-down.png)**Expand** beside ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/CALENDAR FILTER.jpg) **Date of observation** to open the filter section. Click on the **From** and **To** date fields and use the pop-up calendar to define the start date and end date for the timeframe you would like to view. Only observations collected between these dates will be visible.

Click <mark style="color:blue;">**ALL**</mark> to reset the filter and show observations for all dates.

### **Filter by category**

To filter observations by a category, click ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/icon-down.png)**Expand** beside ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Filter options grey.png) **Category** to open the list of the categories used in your project.

* Use the checkboxes to select the categories that you want to make visible.&#x20;
* Click <mark style="color:blue;">**ONLY**</mark> to show observations for a single selected category. &#x20;
* Click <mark style="color:blue;">**ALL**</mark> to reset the filter and show observations for all categories.&#x20;

### Filter by details field

You may also have the option to filter by some of the details fields used in your project. Only details that are "select one" fields (ie. you can only select one of the available answer options) will be available in the **Filter** panel.
