# Use Mapeo Desktop

### Mapeo Desktop

Mapeo Desktop is a desktop application that allows you to aggregate, view and manage data collected with Mapeo Mobile.

It also offers a simple interface for adding or creating territory data for making maps. Mapeo Desktop provides a basic set of mapping features that is more accessible to new tech users than other available geographic information tools, but exporting maps requires knowledge of other software.
