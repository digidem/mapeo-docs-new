By default, Mapeo Desktop uses a base map that shows some geographical elements such as rivers and hills, as well as some political and urban elements such as borders, cities, roads, etc.&#x20;

If you have a custom base map, you can import and use it in Mapeo Desktop without affecting the information collected.&#x20;
