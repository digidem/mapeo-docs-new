# Customization options

Mapeo was built to be highly customizable and allow users to adapt its interface to meet the needs of specific projects. This section covers both translation of the application and the development of custom configurations and base maps in the pages below:

* [translating-mapeo-and-default-configurations.md](translating-mapeo-and-default-configurations.md "mention") (novice, intermediate)
* [custom-configurations.md](custom-configurations.md "mention")(advanced)
* [custom-base-maps.md](custom-base-maps.md "mention") (advanced)

Please note that the customization process for configurations and base maps currently requires significant technical knowledge and will not be accessible to all users.
