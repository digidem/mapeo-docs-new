# Default base map

### About base maps <a href="default-base-map" id="default-base-map"></a>

Mapeo uses base maps to show users their current location and as a background for displaying data collected or created with Mapeo.

### Mapeo's default base map <a href="default-base-map" id="default-base-map"></a>

By default, and if the device is connected to the internet, Mapeo comes with a base map that shows some geographical elements such as rivers and hills, as well as some political and urban elements such as borders, cities, roads, and others.

If the device is not connected to the internet, the base map shown by default is much less detailed. In Mapeo Mobile it only shows the country borders and the main water bodies, while in Mapeo Desktop it does not show any map.​​​​​
