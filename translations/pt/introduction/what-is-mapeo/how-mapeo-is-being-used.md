Mapeo is currently being used by a variety of communities around the globe to support territory mapping and monitoring efforts. Below are a few examples. For more detailed case studies, partner stories and information about other tool for mapping and monitoring, check out our **** [**Earth Defenders Toolkit**](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com) **** website.

Together with park rangers, they collect data on illegal gold mining and other impacts to the Reserve and use these for internal decision making and action as well as sharing with the authorities for any illegalities to be addressed.&#x20;
