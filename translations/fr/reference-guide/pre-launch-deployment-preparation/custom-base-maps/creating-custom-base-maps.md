# Creating custom base maps

We are currently working on a new user interface to simplify the process of generating and adding custom base maps to Mapeo. Once the new functionality is complete, we will include full instructions on this page.

In the interim, you can view documentation of the existing process [here](https://www.notion.so/digidem/Preparing-and-Adding-Custom-Basemaps-to-Mapeo-b4f13019f0b842ce9315c6097f08ce36).
