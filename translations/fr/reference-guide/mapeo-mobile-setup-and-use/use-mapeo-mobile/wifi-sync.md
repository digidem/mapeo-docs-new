# Syncing data via WiFi

Mapeo Mobile allows you to synchronize the data you have collected with other Mapeo users that members of the same project. Syncing data does not require an internet connection and can be done in entirely offline areas.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that by synchronizing with another Mapeo user, **ALL DATA is shared in both directions**. You will receive all of the observations created by that user and they will receive all of your observations. Only synchronize with members of your project whom you trust with all of your data.
{% endhint %}

### Connect to WiFi

Syncing data between 2 devices requires that both devices be connected to the same WiFi network. **This WiFi network does not need to have an internet connection**. In offline environments, a local WiFi network can be created using a mobile wireless router, or by creating a hotspot using a third smartphone.

### Enter Sync mode

In order to synchronize, both devices must be on the Mapeo Sync screen. To open Sync, tap on the orange lightning bolt at the top left of the home screen.

The sync screen will show whether you are connected to a WiFi network.&#x20;

If connected, you will be able to see the name of the network you are connected to in the top left of the navy blue bar. You will also be able to see the unique identification number of your device on the right side of the navy bar.

Devices available for syncing will be listed on the Sync screen. Remember than in order for a device to appear on the list, it must be connected to the same network, have the Mapeo Sync screen open, and be using the same project configuration file. For more on configurations, see [here](broken-reference).

### Synchronize data

Once available devices appear in the list, confirm the identity of the device you plan to synchronize with by consulting the unique identification number on the other user's phone.

Click on the Sync button beside the device number in the list to begin the exchange of data. Keep the Sync screen open on both devices until the synchronization has completed.

### View observations

You can view new observation data received in the sychronization by looking at the points on the Map home screen or by viewing the Observations list.

Observations collected by other users will appear with a blue bar on the left side. On Mapeo Mobile, you cannot edit or delete observations collected by other users. For more on managing data with Mapeo Desktop, see [here](../../mapeo-desktop-setup-and-use/mapeo-desktop-1/).
