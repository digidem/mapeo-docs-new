# Sharing data externally

In Mapeo Mobile, you can share the details of a single observation (location, images, description, and details) with a contact outside of Mapeo by using the ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Share.png) **Share observation** feature. **Share** uses the communication apps you have installed on your phone (email, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, or others) to send information.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember that communication apps will require an internet connection or cell signal to work.
{% endhint %}

Open the **View observation** screen for the selected observation and tap  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Share.png) **Share**, which is located at the bottom left of the screen.&#x20;

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Observation List screen - select observation)  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Share\_button.jpg)\


Select the desired sharing app and enter the contact's information. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/WhatsApp-logo.png)WhatsApp, ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Signal-logo.png)Signal and ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Gmail-logo.png)Gmail are the apps that currently work best for sharing Mapeo observations.

Always exercise caution when sharing data collected, as observations could include sensitive information about locations, activities, or natural resources. Prior to sharing any data, think through basic security precautions.
