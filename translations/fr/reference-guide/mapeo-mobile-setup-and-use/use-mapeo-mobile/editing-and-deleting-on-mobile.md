# Editing and deleting observations

### Edit details

Once you are on the **View observation** screen, you can edit the information collected. To do so, tap ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Edit-pencil.png) **Edit observation**.

In the **Edit observation **screen, you can change the category of the point, edit the description and details, or add additional photos. You cannot change the geographic location saved with the observation, or the date and time of the original observation.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
On Mapeo Mobile, you cannot remove photos from observations once they have been added.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Save changes

Tap ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Save-check.png) **Save **to save the changes you have made. Tap ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_back arrow.png) **Back **to return the **Map **view.

To exit without saving your changes, tap  ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_back arrow.png) **Back **and confirm you want to discard changes.

### Delete observations

To delete an observation you have collected, on the **View observation **screen, scroll to the bottom and tap ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/app icons\_Delete-trash.png) **Delete**. You can only delete observations that you have created on Mapeo Mobile.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Deleting observations cannot be undone, so exercise caution when using delete.**

As Mapeo uses a peer-to-peer database, all data is stored directly on your device and there is no back-up on a centralized server. By deleting observations, you will permanently remove them from your device and all devices you synchronize data with in the future.\ \ For more on synchronization, see [here](broken-reference).
