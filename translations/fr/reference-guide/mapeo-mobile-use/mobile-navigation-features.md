# Activating GPS in Mapeo

### Activate the GPS of your smartphone

Mapeo uses the GPS of your device, so before you start using Mapeo make sure that the GPS in your smartphone is activated.

This might be different on each smartphone, but in most of them, the GPS option appears in the main menu, together with the buttons to activate WiFi, Flight mode, lantern, and other main features.
