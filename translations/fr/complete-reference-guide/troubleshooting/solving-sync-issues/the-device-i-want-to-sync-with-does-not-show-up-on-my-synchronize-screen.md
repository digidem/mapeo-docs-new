# The device I want to sync with does not show up on my Synchronize screen

If Mapeo is not displaying the device you are trying to sync with on the **Synchronize** screen, start by confirming the following:

* [Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network](the-device-i-want-to-sync-with-does-not-show-up-on-my-synchronize-screen.md#both-devices-are-connected-to-the-same-wi-fi-network)
* [Both devices have the **Synchronize** screen open](the-device-i-want-to-sync-with-does-not-show-up-on-my-synchronize-screen.md#both-devices-have-the-synchronize-screen-open)
* [Both devices are using the same configuration](the-device-i-want-to-sync-with-does-not-show-up-on-my-synchronize-screen.md#both-devices-are-using-the-same-configuration)

## Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network

For two devices to sync via Wi-Fi, both need to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. **This Wi-Fi network does not need to have an internet connection**.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more info on how to connect to Wi-Fi, see [connecting-to-wi-fi.md](../connecting-to-wi-fi.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

* [View current Wi-Fi status in ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Desktop.png) **Mapeo Desktop**](the-device-i-want-to-sync-with-does-not-show-up-on-my-synchronize-screen.md#in-mapeo-desktop)

### View current Wi-Fi status in ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Mobile.png) **Mapeo Mobile**:

On the **Synchronize** screen you can view your device's current Wi-Fi status. If connected to Wi-Fi, the name of the network will appear on the left-hand side of the navy blue bar.\ \ ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_sync\_screen\_wifi\_info.jpg)\ \ If your device is not connected to Wi-Fi, you will see a "No WiFi" message with a prompt to open your device's Wi-Fi settings.\ \ ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mm\_sync\_screen\_no\_wifi.jpg)

### View current Wi-Fi status in ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Desktop.png) Mapeo Desktop:

Wi-Fi status for your computer may be displayed at the top of the **Synchronize** screen, under the "**Available Devices"** header.

If you are currently connected, you may see the name of the Wi-Fi network and the current strength of the signal. (Eg. ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Wifi.png)FIOS 7S5YS \*\*`QUALITY: 70%` \*\* ).

{% hint style="warning" %}
In some cases, Mapeo Desktop will not be able to access your computer's Wi-Fi information and no Wi-Fi details will be displayed on the **Synchronize** screen. This does not mean that your computer is not connected.\ \ For more on confirming Wi-Fi status from your computer's operating system, see [connecting-to-wi-fi.md](../connecting-to-wi-fi.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

## Both devices have the Synchronize screen open

Mapeo devices will only appear as available to sync if both devices have the **Synchronize** screen open. The **Synchronize** screen should be kept open until the sync process is complete.

See below for instructions on how to open the Synchronize screen:

* [Open the Synchronize screen in ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Mobile.png) **Mapeo Mobile**](../../mapeo-mobile-use/wifi-sync.md#enter-synchronize-mode)
* [Open the Synchronize screen in ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/Mapeo\_Desktop.png) **Mapeo Desktop**](../../mapeo-desktop-use/using-mapeo-desktop-to-manage-mapeo-mobile-data/syncing-data.md#enter-synchronize-mode)

## Both devices are using the same configuration

In order for two Mapeo devices to sync, they must be using the same configuration. A Mapeo device using a different configuration file will not show up in the list of **Available devices** on the **Synchronize** screen.

{% hint style="info" %}
To learn more about configurations, see [custom-configurations](../../customization-options/custom-configurations/ "mention").
{% endhint %}

## Restarting Mapeo

If you have confirmed all of the steps above and the device you are trying to sync with still does not show up on your **Synchronize** screen, try restarting Mapeo on both devices.
