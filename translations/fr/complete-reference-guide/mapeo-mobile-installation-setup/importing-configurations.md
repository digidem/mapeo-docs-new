# Importing configurations into Mapeo Mobile

To start using a custom configuration, you'll need to import the new configuration file into Mapeo Mobile. For more on configurations, see [custom-configurations](../customization-options/custom-configurations/ "mention").

## Locate the configuration file

Download or copy the configuration file (eg. `example_project.mapeosettings`) onto your Android device. Note which folder the file was saved in.

{% hint style="info" %}
For sending configuration files (`.mapeosettings`) between smartphones with an internet connection, we recommend using the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Telegram-logo.png) **Telegram** app, as other messaging applications have problems with this file format.&#x20;



If you don't have an internet connection, you can copy the file from a computer using a ![](../../.gitbook/assets/USB\_cable.png)**USB cable** or send the file using ![](../../.gitbook/assets/Bluetooth.png)**Bluetooth**. Read more about how to send a file using these methods in [sharing-files-between-devices](../troubleshooting/sharing-files-between-devices/ "mention").
